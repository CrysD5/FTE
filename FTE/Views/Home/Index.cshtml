            <p>
                Carrying a firearm is a significant responsibility, and proper training is essential. A firearm is only as effective as the person handling it, and inadequate preparation can lead to hesitation or ineffective responses in critical situations. At FTE, we help you develop the confidence and skills needed to handle pistols, rifles, and shotguns effectively in defensive combat scenarios. Our training ensures you are equipped to protect yourself and others when it matters most.
